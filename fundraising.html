        <h2>
Why is the Social Club doing fundraisers?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
In the past, the Glenview Social Club only raised money to cover movie night
expenses.  However, as outside funding for our schools decrease, the Social
Club has started exploring additional ways to raise funds for our schools.
        </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>What does the Social Club raise money for? Where does the money go?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The money that the Social Club raises gets used for two purposes: to support events for the students of Glenview Elementary, and to contribute to the PTA General fund.  Our 2025 goal is to raise enough money to pay for all the social events that happen around Glenview Elementary. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Movie Nights</li>
                <li>The fall carnival haunted house</li>
                <li>Spring Thing games and bouncy house</li>
            </ul>

After the expenses for these events are covered, the remainder of the funds raised is donated to the Glenview PTA general fund.  Thus the Social Club fundraising contributes to Glenview PTA general fund in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li>It decreases the amount of money that the PTA needs to budget for community events</li>
                <li>It adds money to the Glenview PTA general fund.</li>
            </ul>
The way we see it, the more money the Social Club generates for the school, the less the PTA needs to raise in their two annual fundraisers.

        <h2>
Why not just raise money through the PTA?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
The PTA restricts itself to two main fundraisers per year, which target the entire school, and which represent the required amount of money to supplement the education of the students.
The Social Club seeks to provide smaller, more creative fundraising events that have the additional benefit of fostering a greater sense of community around the school.  We believe that 
community engagement is not just a nice addition but a vital component of a thriving elementary school. It enriches the learning experience for students, strengthens the school's environment, and provides crucial resources and support.

        <h2>
What fundraisers has the Social Club done?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
 In 2024 we added fundraising events:  
            <ul>
                <li>
A booth at Oaktoberfest, which raised $2000,
                </li>
                <li>
A Golf fundraiser, which raised $300
                </li>
            </ul>
The entire proceeds of both events were contributed directly to the PTA General Fund.

        <h2>
Should I give to the Social Club instead of to the PTA?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
No. If you have limited funds to give, we ask that you prioritize contributing to the two main PTA fundraisers.
Ideally, if the Social Club fundraisers are successful, they will decrease the amount that is requested by the PTA
in their next fundraiser.
